# Instructions  

  1. You’re building a website to launch a rocket to Ceres Station out in the solar system. The web designer forgot to add a button that says “Launch Rocket!” to the HTML. You have to fix it.
  2. Use the .innerHTML property to draw a “Launch!” button inside the HTML <div> container.
  3. When someone clicks the button, display "The rocket has launched!" under the button and inside the container.
